# Jellyfin Watch Updater

## What is it?

Jellyfin Watch Updater is a simple go script/docker container which adds a "lastPlayedDate" to media that has been watched but hasn't had the variable set. 
This is only necessary if 1. you're using a jellyfin client that doesn't properly set that variable (Blink, findroid, probably more) and 2. you're using something like the media cleaner plugin to delete videos that you have watched.

## How do I run it?

### needed env variables (add to a .env):

JELLYFIN_USER_ID=[user you want to set it to played for]
JELLYFIN_API_KEY=[a jellyfin api key}
JELLYFIN_BASE_URL=https://jellyfin.domain.tld

### run options:

#### docker (recommended for continuous use of the clients that don't set it properly)
for latest image release, check the tags or build yourself from source
https://hub.docker.com/r/simoneklundh/jellyfin-watch-updater/tags

The docker image runs the go script once an hour on the hour.

simply run the docker image:
```bash
docker run -d simoneklundh/jellyfin-watch-updater:2.0
```
in the same path as your .env file

#### using go (not recommended, but still completely usable)

This simply runs the script once 

clone the project
install go
cd into the source directory 
go run .
